# Python Student Achievement Analysis  

### Overview  
This project analyzes patterns in student achievement using Python.  
It explores relationships between attendance, assessment scores, and academic performance metrics across multiple schools.  

---

### Tools & Techniques  
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Core Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
  - Statistical summarization and visualization  
  - Insight generation and storytelling through data  

---

### Key Insights  
- **Attendance Matters:** Schools with higher attendance rates generally show stronger academic performance.  
- **Stable Recovery Post-2020:** Attendance dipped slightly in 2019 but rebounded strongly by 2021, reflecting improved student engagement.
