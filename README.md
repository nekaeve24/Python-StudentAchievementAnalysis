# Python Student Achievement Analysis

**Tools:** Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
**Data:** Student achievement dataset (2018-2021)  
**Focus Areas:** Academic performance, attendance impact, and predictive insights

---

## Overview
This project explores patterns in student achievement across multiple schools using Python.  
It focuses on identifying relationships between attendance, assessment scores, and school-level performance indicators.  
The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as **pandas** for data cleaning and transformation, and **matplotlib/seaborn** for visualization.

## Methods & Workflow
| Stage | Tool / Technique | Function
| ------ | -----------------| --------|
| Data Cleaning | pandas | Handle missing data, normalize column formats |
| Analysis | Python, NumPy | Calculate descriptive and comparative metrics |
| Visualization | matplotlib, seaborn | Plot attendance vs. achievement trends |
| Reporting | PDF export | Present key findings and visuals |

## Key Insights
- Higher attendance correlated with stronger assessment performance.
- Schools with lower variability in attendance showed more consistent test outcomes.
- Identified year-over-year performance improvement patterns through visualizations.
